PMS,Phase Measurement Subsystem,The Phase Measurement Subsystem, or often just referred to as "the Phasemeter", is made up of two units: the Interferometric Processor Unit (IPU), and the Phasemeter Control Unit (PCU). More than just measuring and tracking the longitudinal phase of the beatnote between two interferring laser beams, it also does the clock-tone transfer and performs pseudo-range measurements, which are two key parts of the Time Delay Interferometry (TDI) pipeline to compensate for the drifting of the spacecraft and for their imprecise and unmatched clocks. In addition, the Phasemeter establishes a data link between spacecraft via the laser links, contributes to link aquisition via Fourier Transform analysis, and is part of the Drag-Free Attitude Control System (DFACS) loop using its ability to perform Differential Wavefront Sensing (DWS).
